Instructions on running hw5

1) Import database
Database are modified into .sql file in root/databases for easier usage. All farmer markets 
are organized as farmers.sql while all zip records are organized as 
zip_codes_states.sql.
The program is expected to access a database at localhost:3306 with 
username="root", password="lyc0507link". The larger database is named as
"farmers_market", containing "farmers" and "zip_codes_states" as two
smaller databases to query from.

A valid query looks like
    "SELECT * FROM farmers WHERE city LIKE '%s' AND State LIKE '%s' AND zip LIKE '%s' "
from farmers, or 
    "SELECT * FROM zip_codes_states WHERE city LIKE '%s' AND state LIKE '%s' AND (check_coordinates)"
from zip_codes_states

2) Configure packages
1. Copy hw5.war to tomcat_directory/webapps
2. Extract to subdirectory "hw5"
3. Enter hw5 subdirectory. Modify the database infomation of your own in index.jsp
4. Start the tomcat server. Go to https://localhost:8080/hw5.
